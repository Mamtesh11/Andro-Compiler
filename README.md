# Andro-Compiler

Develop an app called “AndroCompile” which can communicate to host machine via wifi access point and provide user an interface for computer language compilers. Some compilers (like gcc, g++, java, etc.) are installed in host machine. AndroCompile will provide the text editor to write and to edit the programs. It also allows storing the program on host machine or in local device. It has one button called “Compile and Run” and one text box for providing user inputs for written program. This button will send the program to host machine via wifi. The program will be compiled and executed in host machine with specified compiler and user inputs. After execution it will returns the result or error messages if any to AndroCompile.

PHP file sould be kept on linux machine with localhost.
